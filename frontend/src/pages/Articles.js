          Check CSS Scope:
          If you're dynamically rendering components or content within your navigatebar function, ensure that the CSS styles you want to apply are scoped correctly. If you're using CSS modules, make sure to import and use styles appropriately.

          Check Class Names:
          Double-check the class names in your CSS file and make sure they match the class names used in your JSX. Also, check for typos or case sensitivity issues.

          Check for Inline Styles:
          If you're applying styles directly in the JSX using inline styles, ensure that they are formatted correctly. Also, make sure that there are no conflicting styles.

          Use DevTools to Debug:
          Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the rendered HTML and styles. This can help identify if the styles are being applied and if there are any conflicts or overrides.
          <br />

          Check for CSS-in-JS Libraries:
          If you are using a CSS-in-JS library (like styled-components or emotion), make sure that the styles are being applied correctly within the function.

          Conditional Rendering:
          If the navigatebar function is conditionally rendering content, ensure that the conditions are met for the content to be rendered with the expected styles.
          <br />

          Check for CSS Specificity:
          If there are conflicting styles, check the specificity of your CSS rules. More specific rules will take precedence. Use more specific selectors or adjust the order of your styles.
          <br />

          If the issue persists, please provide more details about your code, especially the relevant parts of the navigatebar function and the associated CSS. Additionally, check the browser console for any error messages related to CSS or rendering.
