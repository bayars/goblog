# goblog

I created this project to learn golang. Currently, markdown conversion is completely working. I just need to create a good css and html pages.

The gin implementation is in the basic level (basic root serves.)

Markdown code automatically reads templates directory recurisively, and finds .md files. These files are reading line by line. The lines automatically converts to html code. The translated html files automatically, creates blog directory which includes converted html files. 

I am planning to serve the application as static. Gin will read these html files and that will serve with my css and html menus. 

I also planning to use different js/css framework. 

Currently, I am not continue to work on this project. I have a very loaded personal life. I will continue when I am feeling free.
